You know, we've had some great times together, like that hilarious pizza delivery guy mix-up and that time you saved my favorite socks from a laundry disaster
|We've had some amazing moments together. Remember that time we attempted cooking and almost set off the smoke alarm? Good times

Hey, I hope you're sitting down for this, because I have some news.
| Hey, I've been thinking, and I've realized that our relationship has been a bit like a rollercoaster, and I'm more of a Ferris wheel kind of person.
| Hey, I hope you're sitting down because this might come as a shock - we need to talk about something. 
| Hey, good job at your soccer game the other day.

| I hope you know you are such a wonderful person. <Memory> .
| I just want you to know these past few months have been so great with you. <Memory> .

<BreakingUp> =
But you know, I've realized that our relationship is a bit like my smartphone battery - it's just not holding a charge anymore <Excuse> .
|But despite all that, I think we should take some time apart <Excuse> .
|So, I've been thinking, and I've decided that our relationship is a bit like a carnival funhouse â€“ it was thrilling at first, but now it's just making me dizzy. I think it's time to break up.

<Excuse> =
It's not you, it's me
| I feel like I just don't have enough time to play video games with my friends 
| I just need time to focus on tennis

Honestly, now that I think about it, you are always calling me. It's like you can't live without my attention.
| To be honest, you were kind of annoying. Like, I'm not your 24/7 help line. If you needed help with your math homework, you could've called anyone else, but instead you chose to bug me.
| Maybe you were always the problem. I'm so much happier now that I've broken up with you.

<FinalWords> =
Anyways, sorry it had to be like this, I hope we can still be friends. 
| Anways, hope you aren't mad at me. I'm doing what's best for the both of us.
| Hopefully things won't be awkward between us now, but this is what's best. 
| But I'll still always love you... goodbye and thank you for these past few months of my life.
